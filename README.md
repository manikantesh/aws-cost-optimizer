## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) ‚â• 1.0
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions

### Deployment

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-cost-optimizer.git
   cd aws-cost-optimizer

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
    terraform init
3. Apply the desired module (e.g., EC2 Scheduler):
   ```bash
   cd modules/ec2-scheduler
   terraform apply

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Never** commit AWS credentials, secrets, or `.tfstate` files. See [.gitignore](.gitignore).
- Use IAM roles with least privilege for Terraform operations. Example policies are provided in each module (coming soon).
- Review all modules before applying them in production.
- Enable MFA on your AWS accounts.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more.

1. **Clone or fork the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-cost-optimizer.git
   cd aws-cost-optimizer
   ```
2. **Configure AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3. **Initialize Terraform:**

## üõ°Ô∏è Required IAM Permissions (Example)

Each module may require different AWS permissions. Below is a sample policy for running the EC2 Scheduler module:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm",
        "events:PutRule",
        "events:PutTargets",
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- See each module for more specific permissions.
